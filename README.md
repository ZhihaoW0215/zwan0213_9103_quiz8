## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
My inspiration for this assignment was the “fearless” transition from Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour movie. In this transition, the fireworks in the background are falling like a waterfall. I thought it was interesting to have a fountain-like effect with a gradual color change. I want to create the feeling of a bloom and a waterfall by modifying the colors as well as the shape of the particles and other features.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
I will use the Particle System coding technique to replace the circles with other shapes and modify their positions by modifying the speed at which they move and how they are displayed. In addition to this, I will modify their colors to vary within a certain range. I will also modify the direction of movement of the particles to give them some interesting variations.
